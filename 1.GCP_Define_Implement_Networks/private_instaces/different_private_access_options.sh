Google actually provides several different private access options.

Each option allows VM instance with interal IP addresses to reach certain APIs and services.
We can configure one or all of these options because they operate independently of each other.

Private google access for on-premises hosts:
-------------------------------------------------->
Allows you on-premises hosts to reach google APIs and services over a cloud VPN or cloud internet connection from your datacenter to GCP.
your on-premises hosts do not need external IP addresses instead they use interal IPAddresses.



Private Services Access:
-------------------------->
priavte services access is a private connection between your vpc network and a service providers(producers) VPC network.

This connection is implemented as a VPC peering connection and the other service producers network is created exclusively for you and not shared with other customers.
